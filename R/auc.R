#' Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve for an Embedding

#' Embedding quality measure.
#'
#' The PR curve plots precision (also known as positive predictive value, PPV)

#' curve provides similar information compared to the area under the ROC curve,
#' but may be more appropriate when classes are highly imbalanced.

#' Observations with the same label as the Nth observation count as positive

#
# Embedding quality measure.

# The PR curve plots precision (also known as positive predictive value, PPV)
# against recall (also known as the true positive rate). The area under the
# curve provides similar information compared to the area under the ROC curve,
# but may be more appropriate when classes are highly imbalanced.

# This function calculates the curve with the label of the specified

#
# Perfect retrieval results in an AUC of 1. Random retrieval gives a value
# of the proportion of positive class with respect to the entire data set
# (e.g. if there are 20 observations with the positive class label in a
# dataset of 100, then the random AUC is 0.2).
